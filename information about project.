this is my final year project, it is basically biomedical device which collect 
crucial DATA from sensor, here in this project i'm using 3 pulse sensors to collect
VATA, PITTA and KAPHA SIGNAL. i have connected vata pulse sensor to A0/D0 GPIO pin of xiao esp32s3.
pitta is connected to a1/d1 and kapha is connected to a2/d2. 
Ayurveda, a holistic approach to health, centers on the balance of three fundamental biological 
entities known as doshas: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. In Ayurvedic philosophy, the equilibrium of these doshas
is integral to well-being. Various factors, such as dietary habits, stress, and environmental changes, can
disrupt this balance, even in seemingly healthy individuals. When Vata, Pitta, and Kapha are not in harmony,
it can lead to health issues like rheumatoid arthritis, constipation, diarrhea, or asthma.
To enhance the quality of life and provide timely disease detection and patient monitoring, the development
of remote patient monitoring systems is crucial in today's healthcare industry. Many researchers opt for 
noninvasive, cost-effective, real-time pulse monitoring systems. These systems utilize a specific finger 
arrangement with each finger symbolizing one of the doshas â€” Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. For example, the left 
wrist's pulse offers insights into the heart, liver, and kidney, while the right wrist's pulse provides 
information about the lung, spleen, and kidney.
The integration of traditional Ayurvedic principles with cutting-edge technology introduces an innovative
approach to disease detection and monitoring. This solution involves the creation of a unified device that
combines Ayurvedic pulse analysis with modern sensors and wireless communication. Its primary goal is to enable
early disease detection and holistic wellness assessment, marking a significant step towards personalized and comprehensive healthcare.
In the development of an Android application for data collection via Bluetooth, the focus is on gathering vital health data.
This application's core functionality is to capture and analyze signals from Ayurvedic pulse sensors. The collected data is 
then processed and evaluated using advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
These algorithms draw from a comprehensive database to provide valuable insights into an individual's health and well-being.
By combining cutting-edge technology with the principles of Ayurveda, this application aims to offer users a holistic approach to health assessment.
It enables early disease detection, monitors the balance of Vata, Pitta, and Kapha doshas, and provides personalized recommendations for improved well-being. 
The incorporation of AI and ML ensures that the analysis is both accurate and tailored to the individual, making it a powerful tool for proactive health management.
Presently, this technique is subjective and the accuracy of the diagnosis depends upon the expertise of the Ayurvedicphysician.
As a first step towards making the diagnosis by nadi-pariksha objective, humanpulse detection and processing system has been developed.
